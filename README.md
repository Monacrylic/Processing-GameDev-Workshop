## Processing Code Best Practices

1) Have one .pde file which contains only the setup and draw function named as <name_of_the_game.pde>

2) Create a class for every object in the game. For instance in brick-breaker, you should have classes for Brick, Paddle and Ball.

3) Name the variables properly, and follow camelCasing throughout!

4) Try to minimize hardcoded values, by specifying distace paramenters relative to height and width of the screen like width/2 or height/someVariable.
